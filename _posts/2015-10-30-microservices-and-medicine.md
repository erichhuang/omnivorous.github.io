## Microservices & Medicine
`Data Science is an interdisciplinary field about processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from large volumes of data in various forms, either structured or unstructured (Wikipedia)` 

Medicine is the ultimate data science. When you're sitting across a patient in an exam room, you are summarizing structured data (e.g. laboratory tests) and unstructured data (e.g. clinic notes, journal articles) into a decision that (hopefully) represents the best interpretation of all those data according to the needs of your patient. 

More than a year ago, the computer scientist and blogger, Martin Fowler, wrote a wonderful post (with his colleague James Lewis) about ["Microservices"](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html), an architectural style for breaking applications into "service" components that can operate independently. Put their way:

> In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to
 developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in
 its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP
 resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and
 independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery.
 
So what on earth does this have to do with healthcare and biomedical research? We've got people to take care of, cures to discover, why should we care whether about the architectural style of software?
